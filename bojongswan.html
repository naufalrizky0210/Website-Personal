                                        To effectively manage inventory and finances, it is crucial to define the key entities and their attributes within the system. Each entity represents a fundamental component of the business process, while its attributes capture specific details necessary for accurate tracking and reporting. 
                                        Below is an overview of the entities and attributes designed for the Inventory and Finance System for Bojongswan Coffee.

                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>Customer:</strong> Represents the customers of Bojongswan Coffee. Each customer is identified by a unique <code>CustomerID</code> and includes attributes like <code>Name</code> and <code>ContactInfo</code>, which facilitate better customer tracking.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>SalesTransaction:</strong> This entity captures every sale made at the store. It is uniquely identified by <code>TransactionID</code> and contains attributes such as <code>Date</code> and <code>TotalAmount</code> to ensure accurate financial records.
                                        </li>

                                            <strong>OrderDetail:</strong> Represents the details of products sold in each transaction. Each <code>OrderDetail</code> includes <code>OrderID</code>, <code>ProductID</code>, <code>Quantity</code>, and <code>Price</code> to ensure complete documentation of individual orders.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p class="constraint-bridging">
                                        Constraints help define the rules governing relationships between entities in a database. For example, in the relationship between the <strong>User</strong> and <strong>SalesTransaction</strong> entities, one <strong>User</strong> may process many <strong>SalesTransaction</strong> records. This relationship has a cardinality of <strong>1:N</strong>, meaning "one-to-many," and a participation of <strong>Total:Total</strong>, indicating that every <strong>User</strong> must participate in at least one <strong>SalesTransaction</strong> and vice versa.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="constraint-bridging">
                                        Cardinality defines the number of instances of one entity that can or must be associated with instances of another entity. For instance, the <strong>1:N</strong> cardinality in the <strong>User</strong>-<strong>SalesTransaction</strong> relationship shows that a single <strong>User</strong> can process multiple <strong>SalesTransactions</strong>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="constraint-bridging">
                                        Participation defines the extent to which an entity must be involved in a relationship. Total participation in the <strong>User</strong>-<strong>SalesTransaction</strong> relationship (<strong>Total:Total</strong>) means that every <strong>User</strong> must process at least one <strong>SalesTransaction</strong>, and every <strong>SalesTransaction</strong> must be linked to a <strong>User</strong>.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                        The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the Bojongswan Coffee App illustrates the relationships between key entities in the inventory and financial management system. It highlights how data is structured, interconnected, and supports seamless operations. 
                                        Here we define the entities within our ERD design

                                        By designing this ERD, the Bojongswan Coffee App ensures that all critical data relationships are effectively captured. This design simplifies database maintenance, improves data accuracy, and ensures that each entity interacts seamlessly with others in the system.
                                        The ERD also supports the implementation of key business processes such as inventory tracking, sales monitoring, and customer relationship management. It enables real-time updates across the system, ensuring that sales and stock levels are synchronized.
                                        With a robust ERD design, the Bojongswan Coffee App achieves several business benefits:

                            The Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) design for the Bojongswan Coffee App establishes a structured framework for organizing and managing data efficiently.
                            it is essential to define Primary Keys (PK) and Foreign Keys (FK), which are the building blocks of relational data models.

                                <strong>Primary Key:</strong>
                                A Primary Key is a unique identifier for a record within a table. It ensures that every row in a table can be uniquely identified and prevents duplicate data. For example:
                                In the User table, the <code>UserID</code> serves as the primary key.
                                In the Customer table, the <code>CustomerID</code> is the unique identifier.
                                Other tables like SalesTransaction and OrderDetail use <code>TransactionID</code> and <code>OrderID</code>as primary keys, respectively. 
                            </li>
                            <li class="rdbms-fk">
                                <strong>Foreign Key:</strong>
                                A Foreign Key is an attribute in one table that establishes a link to the Primary Key in another table. It enforces relationships between entities and maintains referential integrity.
                                For example:
                                The <code>UserID</code> in the SalesTransaction table references the <code>UserID</code> in the User table.
                                The <code>CustomerID</code> in the SalesTransaction table links to the Customer table.
                                The <code>TransactionID</code> in the OrderDetail table connects to the SalesTransaction table.

                                        In the Bojongswan Coffee App, the User table is defined using the <code>CREATE TABLE</code>command in SQL. The table is designed to store essential user information such as UserID, Name, and Email while ensuring data integrity through the use of constraints like the Primary Key.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="ddl-user-constraints">
                                        The design process begins with defining each column's data type and constraints. The <code>UserID</code> attribute is a VARCHAR(20) field, meaning it can hold up to 20 characters. It is further constrained as a Primary Key to enforce uniqueness. Similarly, the <code>Name</code> and <code>Email</code> attributes also use the VARCHAR(20) data type, allowing storage of textual data with a maximum length of 20 characters. 
                                        Both columns are nullable, making them optional entries in the table

                                        The design process starts by defining the data type and constraints for each column. The <code>CustomerID</code> column is defined as an <code>INT</code> data type, which stores numeric values and serves as the Primary Key. This constraint enforces uniqueness, ensuring that each customer record is distinct.
                                        Additionally, the <code>Name</code> and <code>ContactInfo</code> columns use the <code>VARCHAR</code> data type, allowing storage of textual data. The <code>Name</code> field can hold up to 20 characters, whereas the <code>ContactInfo</code> field is limited to 15 characters. Both columns are nullable, which means they can be left empty if needed.

                            In the Database DML (Data Manipulation Language) section, we focus on the practical implementation of our database by inserting meaningful data into the predefined tables. This is primarily achieved using the <code>INSERT INTO</code> query alongside the <code>VALUES</code> clause. 
                            These queries play a critical role in populating our database with the necessary records, ensuring the system is equipped to support real-world operations seamlessly.
